 <div class="p1">In The Programmed Designer and The Internet's Back to the Land Movement readings, I've come to understand that in terms of design and technologies, the act of commodifying for profit is often evident; especially from corporations. This act changes the intent or purpose of what design and technology initially offers for the individual and is what the two readings articulates. Design and technologies are two areas that integrate the idea of the Utopian world, and one that utilizes self-expression. Commodifying those two areas engenders a standard that limits creativity, growth, and independence which corporations establish that upsets the works of independent artists and technological communities.
<br>
<br>
 What the two readings then suggest is for those independent artists and communities to seek different ways to escape from corporate practices by looking at different mediums and/or programs for artists, and for tech communities to engage in a more peer-to-peer community. As an example, I try to integrate relief printing into my designs as it helps me to study letterforms and it allows me to create organic forms that are not too restrictive. For technology, I push myself to take a break when I become too invested to the trends or style of certain design works. These techniques do help sometimes, but avoiding corporate standards is difficult but not impossible.

 <div class="p2">Universal Users can also be known as the General Purpose User, one that is not limited to the devices and applications in which they create in. In this article by Olia Lialina, the Universal User can be viewed as an individual who seeks out their aspirations regardless of the mediums or tools one uses to achieve it, one who liaise with hardware and software. An example Lialina uses is how an individual can use alternative applications for the same features of another application - using a website instead of Twitter to blog. In regards to Schwulst’s argument, individual websites provide the independence in which Universal Users are creating for themselves on other platforms that restrict accessibility. Lialina demonstrates this notion as everyday working individuals creating work on programs that were intended for different purposes, but still producing what was expected; using “Live Journal” as Twitter and using Twitter as Twitter.
<br>
<br>
 In reference to Olia Lialina’s concepts of computer users, in some aspects I would describe myself as a General Purpose User given that I like to discover various ways of completing tasks at a sufficient pace. I often find myself using different applications intended for different purposes solely because it is simple to use and produces the same outcomes as it would with the appropriate applications. For example, using phone applications and producing work from there, rather than using inDesign just to push out more personal works.

 <br>
 I came across this web design by Chrome Experiments that takes on an interesting and interactive approach to Google Maps. The features are quite simple, draw or drag and allows the user to interact with the open webspace with their mouse. It allows the user to draw any variation of lines with their mouse pad and the page will give a randomized location that takes on the shape of the given line with the "Draw" feature. The image above is from their "Drag" feature which follows the mouse tracks and display various locations that outlines certain features of the Google landscapes. I believe they used a certain image-recognizing programming code that links to possible line shapes which the user may use because I noticed that the lines or the direction I am directing my mouse is not exactly the ay I interpret it to be. However, this web design creates an innovative user experience for Google's maps and Earth.

 <b>What they actually used:</b>
 <br>- Line Detection; OpenCV (Links to an external site.) Structured Forests (Links to an external site.) and ImageJ’s Ridge Detection; (Links to an external site.) identify dominant visual lines in the initial dataset of 50,000+ images
 <br>- Fast Data Lookup;  vantage point tree (Links to an external site.) for Draw application to find matches quickly
 <br>- WebGL; Pixi.js (Links to an external site.), an open source library built upon the WebGL API, to rapidly draw and redraw 2D WebGL graphics
 <br>- Google Cloud Storage
